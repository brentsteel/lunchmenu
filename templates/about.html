            <h2>🌟 Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                {{ business_name }} was founded in 2020 with a simple mission: to provide delicious, affordable lunches 
                to busy professionals across London. What started as a single location in the City Centre has grown 
                into a beloved chain serving thousands of satisfied customers each week.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe that everyone deserves a great lunch without breaking the bank. That's why we created our 
                signature £5 lunch deal – a complete meal that doesn't compromise on quality or taste.
            </p>

            <h2>🥖 Our Commitment to Quality</h2>
            <p>
                Every sandwich is made fresh to order using locally sourced ingredients. We partner with trusted 
                suppliers who share our commitment to quality and sustainability. Our bread is baked daily, our 
                vegetables are crisp and fresh, and our proteins are carefully selected for flavor and quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                We take pride in offering options for everyone – whether you're looking for a classic combination 
                or something more adventurous, we've got you covered.
            </p>

            <h2>🌍 Sustainability</h2>
            <p>
                We're committed to reducing our environmental impact. All our packaging is recyclable or compostable, 
                we minimize food waste through careful planning, and we're always looking for ways to operate more 
                sustainably.
            </p>

            <h2>👥 Our Team</h2>
            <p>
                Behind every great sandwich is a dedicated team member who takes pride in their work. Our staff are 
                trained to deliver fast, friendly service while maintaining the highest standards of food safety and 
                quality. Many of our team members have been with us since day one, and their experience and dedication 
                show in every meal we serve.
            </p>

            <h2>🎯 Our Values</h2>
